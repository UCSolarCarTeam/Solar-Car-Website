To mark the exciting start of our Schulich Legacy Project, I had the great honour of connecting with James Snell who offered an inside look at being one of the very first members of the University of Calgary Solar Car team, working on the first prototype car X1 and first-generation car Soleon. James completed two degrees at the University of Calgary, one in Computer Science and one in Computer Engineering. During much of that time, he lived and breathed Solar Car. He is now a Professional Engineer with over 10 years of industry experience. We would also like to give a special thanks to Jonathan Groeneweg, the photographer for the Soleon team, for providing us with the photos of the team.

At the first call-to-arms meeting in 2005, James was the only computer science student to join the team and he took on various roles, as was common in those early days. His responsibilities ranged from prototype implementation, Linux systems administration, solar car driving and helping the business team promote the car around Canada. Some of his more memorable tasks include:

-   Helping to fabricate the fibreglass body of the X1 car (shown above)
-   Soldering together countless AA batteries to make battery packs for the X1
-   Trailering the completed Soleon aero shell back to Calgary from Gander, Newfoundland
-   Rigorous physical training to drive laying flat as part of the original driver team
-   Sourcing parts and assembling two top-speced workstations for CAD and CFD use
-   Driving the X1 car in the Calgary Stampede
-   Driving Soleon in parades in Gander, Newfoundland and at Lethbridge Whoop-up Days
-   Presenting Soleon at various local events, tradeshows and so forth

Reading about James’ experience was inspiring, especially to hear how the original team faced incredible hardship with an unbreakable entrepreneurial and innovative spirit. Their work and values have laid the groundwork for our team today.

**What was the hardest technical challenge when building Soleon and how did the team overcome it?**

Probably the fabrication of the aero shell. We didn’t have an autoclave to produce it in and the team was so new we weren’t sure we could build something similar in the 8-month time frame from our start to our first NASC. So we had a few team members work closely with Sikorski Helicopters out in Gander Newfoundland to produce a carbon fibre & kevlar aero shell. This became the body of Soleon. No doubt, there were other major challenges, I think encapsulation of the solar cells was a major problem as well.

**What were some significant changes from the prototype car X1 to Soleon?**

The prototype (X1) car was a quick test platform so we could try out our electrical motor, controls and motor controller. It also gave the drivers something to practice with. We did our initial test driving at the far north end of Lot 10. The prototype’s body was Fireglass and it used battery packs that were made of a near-infinite number of AA batteries. The prototype car had no real solar array, the “cells” you see in photos were just stickers to complete the look as the car was used for some promotional events in Calgary while Soleon was off racing.

I eventually was tasked with demolishing the prototype car shell. I learned that swinging a sledge-hammer at fibreglass can cause the hammer head to bounce back at you. Turns out fibreglass is insanely strong and surprisingly elastic! The chassis for the prototype ended up hanging from the wall of the workshop.

**What was your most memorable moment on the team?**

During our first NASC (North American Solar Challenge), when Soleon crossed the finish line in Calgary, the energy was incredible. I was there to receive Soleon and driver Kyle when they arrived in town. I arranged for a big orange-crush cooler with ice to throw over Kyle as a kind of celebration, he got soaked heavily, like 5 ice-bucket challenges at once. Once across the finish line, Kyle burst out of Soleon cheering wildly at the top of his lungs. We could barely move around the car as there was a sea of fans clapping and cheering us on wildly. It had been a major 8-month push from nothing to having a car that successfully completed in that “rayce” (not sure if folks still call it a “rayce” but we did). Our success was due to the great effort of countless students and staff. It could never have happened without some major and generous support from our industry sponsors as well as the newly-minted Schulich School of Engineering. Interestingly, I now work for one of those sponsors; NovAtel Inc.

_Seymour Schulich donated $25 million (another $25 million was matched by the Alberta government) to the University of Calgary Engineering department, which was renamed the_ [_Schulich School of Engineering_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulich_School_of_Engineering) _after Soleon’s finishes at NASC (North American Solar Challenge) and WSC (World Solar Challenge)._

**What was the biggest accomplishment of the team?**

The original main goal was to build a competitive car and make it across the finish line in the 2005 NASC (North American Solar Challenge). We absolutely accomplished this, with much sweat, tears and more. The first team pulled together from very little and competed under an almost comically tight time-frame. I think one way we really shone was we had a massive Haskayne business team that was incredibly effective at promoting the team. We had the car on breakfast television, at every possible convention and trade-show we could find. Of course, the Engineering side was profoundly essential to producing a competitive car. Our Engineering Teams also worked tirelessly to deliver us across those first finish lines.

**How has your experience with Solar Car shaped your future?**

As the only Computer Science student involved in the first few years, the team introduced me to a different mindset than what I was used to. The initial team was heavily an entrepreneurial group and I was introduced to business development, marketing and electrical and mechanical prototyping. I still use those skills today. I went on to apply many of the same mindsets that worked so well in the original team while working in an R&D (research and development) group of a Calgary-based aerial surveying company (LiDAR Services International). Through that role, I often would design, implement and operate (as aircraft crew) electrical and mechanical solutions to real-world problems on a tangible deadline and with a pragmatic budget, much like the first Solar Car experience went.  


I graduated 10 years ago and my time with the Solar Car team has shaped my entire career as an EIT and now as a Professional Engineer. My experiences with the team shifted my thinking and how I approach problems. I think it has substantially boosted my success in my career. Beyond typical coursework, the most career-shaping experiences I had at the University of Calgary were the Solar Car team and doing an internship, I deeply recommend both, for students of any faculty.

**What are your hopes for the future of the University of Calgary Solar Car Team?**

I hope the team continues to bring together students from various faculties and grants them a challenge to learn and operate an innovative engineering-inspired business. Solar Racing is one noteworthy and exciting arena for this type of competition.  

Ultimately, what made the best impact on my career wasn’t the details about building and racing a solar car, it was pulling people together from many walks of life, collaborating, learning together and heavily promoting what we were doing. It can be an extreme challenge to balance your academics, personal life and team life, but teams like this are a massive value-add when doing your University of Calgary degree.
