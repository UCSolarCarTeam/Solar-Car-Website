# FSGP 2019 Day 1
by  University of Calgary Solar Team

Hello!

Today was the official first day of the Formula Sun Grand Prix! We flew out on Sunday and meet up with the team that drove the car down. Everyone and everything made it to Austin Texas okay. The night upon arrival the team spent most of the night working on the car to ensure that our first day went well.

The first day of the Formula Sun Grand Prix was super busy. We started the day with load in and registration. The teams participating in FSGP have the incredible experience of using the paddocks at the Circuit of the Americas. We unloaded the car and our equipment and headed to the first team meeting. During this meeting, all of the participating teams went over an event overview and a safety review. We all presented our cheers. Our cheer came to a team member in a dream.

“We got the batteries in the back,

Solar cells attached,

Calgary’s on the track

So you should watch your back.”

-Liam Stoddard

During the day, the Formula Sun Grand Prix shared the track and padlocks with the Taylor Lynn Foundation which was doing a fundraising event. We were able to watch amazing cars race around the track while we worked on our cars. Our team is also very lucky to have Larry as our faculty advisor. He has been a huge help throughout our trip so far and also an amazing chef.

Our team had a lot of learning experiences today. There were a few hiccups during the testing which everyone worked really hard to fix. It was a long day on the track. Most of the team left around 11pm. Although we had a minor setback, our team still is in high spirits. There are so many fantastic teams here and staff here. Being able to experience a project this large of scale with hundreds of other students is a once in a lifetime opportunity. We are looking forward to getting back to work tomorrow!
