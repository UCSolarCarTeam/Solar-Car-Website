# Racing Alongside Energy Futures Lab
by  University of Calgary Solar Team

Since 2004, the University of Calgary Solar Car Team has been pushing the 
boundaries of solar vehicle technology. Using 18 years of experience from racing 5 
generations of vehicles, we work to educate our community on the potential of 
sustainable technology. Having created the first cruiser class solar car in Canada, we 
strive to make the next innovation in the fast-paced world of solar racing.



Our current vehicle, Schulich Elysia, stands as an example of this mindset, 
having achieved a 1st in class and 4th overall finish at the Formula Sun Grand Prix 
(FSGP) upon its debut in 2019. Now, after nearly 3 years away from competition - due 
to forces out of anyoneâ€™s control - Schulich Elysia made its return to racing and the 2022
FSGP podium as the team achieved a momentous 3rd place finish. 



In the past few months, the team has had to constantly evaluate how we worked,
having only 6 months to prepare Elysia to return to competition, after sitting untouched 
for so long. Having brushed off layers of dust and relentlessly working to prepare the car
and ourselves for competition against teams without the same constraints, we achieved 
success again. While setting new team records, such as completing nearly 2000km of 
person distance, we deepened our understanding of how to move forward creating our 
next-generation vehicles.



This success would not have been possible without sponsors such as Energy 
Futures Lab who has been a steadfast supporter of our desire to inspire and educate 
through innovation in the field of solar technology. Being able to explore new 
possibilities and analyze complex topics around creating sustainable technologies is 
something that we share a passion with Energy Futures Lab, who allows us to be 
creative and push the boundaries of what is possible. The University of Calgary Solar 
Car Team thanks you for all your support!
