Following the reveal of our sixth-generation vehicle Helios, we continue our Schulich Legacy Project speaking with 2005-2007 alum Shawn Zwierzchowski. Shawn was a dedicated member of the team quickly rising through the ranks, starting as a grunt worker on Soleon, followed by a promotion to Electrical Manager then Chief Engineer through the building of Schulich 1 and finally as a frequent advisor on Axiom. Shawn completed an Electrical Engineering degree at the University of Calgary where he joined the team in his second year (lured by the promise of a pizza lunch). He now has over 10 years of entrepreneurial and industry experience and is ranked among the top 100 players in Canada in squash.

During our conversation, Shawn recounted many inside stories as he led the team through 3 races on 2 different continents. From his response to the frightening crash of Schulich 1 to running with the car strapped to his back through Alice Springs, Shawn shares his insight for success in high-stress situations and reflects on the future of the team and solar technology. Speaking with Shawn, it was evident that although the team has evolved and technology has advanced, team management and member culture remain an important pillar for the growth of our team.

We would like to thank Shawn for his time and willingness to speak about his experiences with the University of Calgary Solar Car Team, and special thanks to team photographer Jonathan Groeneweg for providing access to his photos. Below are Shawn’s responses paraphrased.

The team at the 2007 World Solar Challenge in Australia for Schulich I’s racing debut.

**When did you join and what were some memorable tasks you had working on Soleon?**  

I joined quickly after the pizza lunch in late September, 2004. At that point the solar cells and batteries were on order, the race was in July, 2005 and the team had to have a functioning car in 9 months. I was 1 of 3 guys who  built the aeroshell of X1 in the Airdrie airport (the aeroshell for X1 was the same for Soleon). The foam molds were milled on campus (EVDS 5 axi router) and cut into 8 quarter molds (4 top 4 bottom). The molds were then assembled, coated and the fibreglass shell pulled (at the airport). X1 was built concurrently with Soleon, with X1 being the heavier workable prototype. Soleon was built with an aluminum space frame and came together in June with 20 hours of testing under its belt before being trailered down to race in Texas for the 2005 North American Solar Challenge (NASC).  

In regards to the grunt work and time crunch, I can speak eloquently on soldering 810 AA batteries together and frequently stopping by the former cinnamon bun stall which opened at 2 am while working late nights and early mornings.

**What were significant changes from Soleon to Schulich 1?**  

The main differences were driven by the change in requirements from the World Solar Challenge (WSC), which was aimed to make it more like a real car by implementing things like an upright seating position and additional lights. Another big change was that the budget exploded. Soleon had a budget of around $300K, while almost $700K was spent on Schulich 1. The single biggest increase was switching from monocrystalline silicon to gallium arsenide solar cells. For reference, the solar cells on Soleon each produced 3 Watts for 4 inches squared-ish, ran at 20% efficiency and were $24 each, summing to $65K for the array and encapsulation costs. Schulich 1 sourced their solar cells from EMCOR (they supply solar cells to NASA) who sold seconds at a 90% discount. Cells were 1 inch squared, ran at 27% efficiency and cost $24 each. The array alone cost 185K.  
_Seconds were products not able to meet NASA’s high bar of quality but were still functional._

**How was racing in Australia for the first time for the 2005 World Solar Challenge (WSC) and how did the logistics work out?**  

We had to create and fly Soleon to Australia. We also had 2 more crates with tools and supplies (drill, welder, spare solar cells etc.). Because you needed a drill to open the crates I flew to Australia with a drill, batteries for the drill and a spare motor (which was acting up) for the car in my backpack. The motor weighed 50 lbs and somehow I didn’t get an excess baggage charge but did get inspected by TSA (for obvious reasons).  

The best way to describe the route book was to start at Darwin Legislature, drive down the driveway, take a right, take a left and drive 4 blocks, take a right and drive 2, 997 km then stop. You basically drive straight through the Red Centre of Australia. My biggest memory was being 100 km from Ayers Rock or Uluru 3 times and never seeing it.  

Another highlight was pulling a car through Alice Springs at 6:30 am. For the most part for NASC and WSC we would camp. For some context, it was the second day of racing and we stopped at the check zone at around 4:15 pm (you have to stay at check zones for 30 mins to account for things like driver fatigue). The only campground open was 3km away south. Since the end time was 4:30 pm we needed to head back with the car to the check zone in the morning for 15 mins to finish the time required before continuing on. First thing in the morning we had to get the car and the chase vehicles back up to the check zone but the other guys were tearing down tents. So I took 2 tie-down straps attached to the roll cage and harnessed myself to the car, put a driver in the car and ran it back. It was about a 10-15 min run through Alice Springs. You know some people take their dogs out for a run in the morning, I take a car, casual.  
_Ayers Rock, or Uluru is a massive sandstone monolith with a prominence of 348m (1,142 ft) in the heart of Australia’s “Red Centre”. The nearest large town is Alice Springs, 450km away._

[Schulich 1 Crash Cleanup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6BHFXSV_EE_)

**How did the Schulich 1 crash at the 2007 World Solar Challenge (WSC) happen?**  

The crash happened ⅔ of the way down the straight during pre-qualifying. I was the Chief Engineer at that time, working in the pits away from a radio when the pit marshall said, “Hey can you send a couple of members to clean up debris from your blowout?”. OK, flat tire, debris, wait…debris? I started running down the straightaway.  

The rear wheel had blown out (at that time cars had 2 front and 1 rear tires), and Schulich 1 spun into a fishtail and the backend hit the guardrail. What impressed me was that the backend of the vehicle was made out of several layers of kevlar wrapped around a foam core with epoxy teardrop LEDs for tail lights, this was 1 ½ inches of materials and the gap in the guardrail was ¼ inch. The best part was that the lights still worked.

**How did you handle the Schulich 1 crash?**  

We took the car back, got lunch, and I said to take half an hour to come up with ideas (at that point we had 36 hours until scrutineering). We ended up building an aluminum space frame, addressed the aerodynamics and taped something similar to an airplane wing on the ribs with skin over it. It ran.  

The tire had blown out at 80 km/h and the car hit the rail at 40-50 km/h. The biggest compliment I had ever received and probably my proudest moment as Chief Engineer was when Matt –the driver — walked away from the crash and told me the car was good and he felt safe. He walked away with a slightly sore wrist.

**What advice do you have for the team, team leaders and for working in high-pressure situations?**  

On the team, you deal with varying levels of commitment of people. You need to be able to figure out what you need to do, how long you have, what sort of staffing you need and make sure there is alignment. Figure out how much you can chew with the manpower you have and don’t be afraid to reach out.  

Another piece of advice is to make sure it’s fun. The team needs to feel like they’re contributing. Remind them of their accomplishments and make sure you celebrate them. Every couple of months have a team BBQ or otherwise celebrate team milestones, everyone likes to be fed for free. Spend 2-3 hours of explicit downtime with the team, unwind and build camaraderie. This helps with high-pressure situations in the future. Small things like that show members are valued and pay dividends. There used to be something called POETS in the ENGG lounge on Friday nights (Piss On Everything Tomorrow is Saturday). Engineers push themselves fairly hard so you need an outlet.  

Speaking again about putting the car through the barrier, several guys told me I had handled it well. To me, it was 3 steps. 1. Get the car in the garage. 2. Tell everyone the issues. 3. Make food. It was deliberate, we know what we got to deal with, let’s go chill for a bit, spend some time, think it over, let’s eat. Take care of the team, they’re the most important; this cannot be understated.

Fun fact: this photo was probably taken 15 minutes before MIT tried to take a corner too hard and punched the wheel hub through the composite wheel and rolled their car on the turn at -12.447583, 130.907434. The composite rim was designed for lightweight and high efficiency running in a straight line, not cornering forces on a race track.

**What are your thoughts on the future of Solar Car teams and Solar Car technology?**  

The race is a crucible. Something that puts high stress on the team and the car. You come out forged in a stronger way. To me, the goal is to do the best we can do with the time, money and resources we have. If we are pushing ourselves to the limit, the car is almost irrelevant. But at the end of the day, the biggest goal of Solar Car is to make sure there is a novel challenge for teams to compete in.  

Maybe someone can figure out a battery storage method that can be refilled as a gas vehicle can, we’re talking 2-3 minutes from 0 to full. Currently, Tesla superchargers are on the order of 2 hours. Solar technology is all about clean, green and efficiency. Apart of me wants to go affordable and another part that says screw affordability, build the best you can and show what the capability of the technology is. Take experience from previous teams and implement something new. You can’t completely rely on the old, learn and stand on their shoulders. What does that mean for the car? Sky’s the limit.  

There’s a part of me that wishes the challenger class pushed for more 2 people, 2 golf clubs, (Ferrari’s and Lamborghini’s can carry the same) do it how you want. I think we’d see more interesting things. I also think there’s a place for the classic solar cars, the thin ultra low profile flying saucers. They show you how much you can do with how little. At the 2005 WSC, there was a team from the Netherlands whose biggest issue was the lead and chase vehicles running out of fuel. At one point someone had to hang out the back of the window with a jerry can while travelling down the road at 130 km/h because there were no gas stations in the middle of Australia and Nuna (their solar car) was not stopping.
