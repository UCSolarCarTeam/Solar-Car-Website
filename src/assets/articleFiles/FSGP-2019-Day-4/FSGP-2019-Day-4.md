JULY 4, 2019
# FSGP 2019 Day 4: â€¦and so it begins!
by  University of Calgary Solar Team

Hello!

July 4th was our first day of racing at the 2019 FSGP. Follow along with live race results  [here](http://racehero.io/events/formula-sun-grand-prix). We passed our MOV (multi-occupancy vehicle) scrutineering early in the morning so were ready to head to the start line when the track opened. Before racing began, all the cars and teams gathered on the track for a group photo. It was fun to see all the cars together!

A group photo before the start of racing. Spot the Elysia!

Once the group photo was taken we lined the Elysia up on the track and got our drivers settled in. Only cars that have completed scrutineering can start racing so we ended up at the only multi-occupancy vehicle at the start line. We had been scheduled to be the fifth car off the line but another team had technical difficulties, so we headed off fourth.

Much of our driving time was spent figuring out the intricacies of the car as we had limited high speed driving practice before the event. Our rescue crew was out on track a lot and got a great workout. Thanks guys! Once the drivers got the hang of things it was smooth sailing. When time was called at 6 pm we had completed 30 laps, good for 5th overall.

Catching the last rays of sun to get ready for tomorrow.

We had a two-hour window to charge our battery before it was impounded until Friday. To close out the day we played some football, watched the Fourth of July fireworks, and ate cupcakes. It was a great end to a long day of racing and we are excited to get back on the track tomorrow.
