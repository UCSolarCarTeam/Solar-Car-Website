# SkipTheDepot Fundraiser
by University of Calgary Solar Team

Got some empty bottles around? We’ll take them off your hands! We’ve recently partnered with SkipTheDepot to help us fundraise for upcoming races and our next car Schulich Helios.



SkipTheDepot is an Alberta company that will bring your bottles to the Depot for you, meaning you can skip the hassle of carrying them down to the bottle depot yourself. SkipTheDepot will handle the pickup, drop off, and will donate all the proceeds to our team! The best part is it takes only a few minutes to book an appointment and get started.



If you are interested in contributing we’ve created some simple to follow steps.



### Step 1: Create an Account and Register

If you used our team link above our team should be automatically selected for you! If not, you can use the search menu to find us.



Currently, we are having some friendly competition to see which sub-team can get the highest amount of donations. So, if you have friends or family in the team you can contribute your donation to their sub-team to help them out! Otherwise, feel free to keep this section as a “General Donation”.



Once you’ve selected our team click “Donate Now” to continue.

### Step 4: Book Your Pickup
